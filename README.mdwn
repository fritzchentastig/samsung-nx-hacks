# Samsung NX Smart Camera Hacks

**This project is rather dormant since 2015, and wouldn't mind getting an interested and committed new maintainer.**

This is a collection of scripts, hacks and knowledge for the Linux-based
Samsung NX camera models. This project is work-in-progess, aimed at power
users who have no fear of formatting their SD card, upgrading and downgrading
firmware etc.
