# Samsung NX Smart Camera Hacks

**This project is rather dormant since 2015, and wouldn't mind getting an interested and committed new maintainer.**

This is a collection of scripts, hacks and knowledge for the Linux-based
Samsung NX camera models. This project is work-in-progess, aimed at power
users who have no fear of formatting their SD card, upgrading and downgrading
firmware etc.

**This information is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. The authors take no responsibility for deleting your
baby photographs, bricking your expensive camera or making demons fly out of
your nose.**
